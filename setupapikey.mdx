To use our API, you must have an API key. This key authenticates your requests and allows us to associate your usage with your account.

## Generating Your API Key

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Navigate to your Dashboard" icon="layout-dashboard">
    Go to your account dashboard and find the **API Keys** section. This is typically located under **Settings** or **Developer Options**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 2: Create a New Key" icon="key">
    Click on the **"Create New Key"** or **"Generate API Key"** button. You may be prompted to give your key a name to help you identify it later. We recommend using a descriptive name, such as "My Awesome App Key".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 3: Copy and Secure Your Key" icon="copy">
    Your new API key will be displayed on the screen. **This is the only time you will see the full key**, so be sure to copy it and store it in a secure location. For security reasons, we do not store your key in a way that is retrievable.

    <Note>
        Treat your API key like a password. Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

## Using Your API Key

To authenticate your requests, you must include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request. The header should be in the format `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.

Here is an example of how to use the API key with `curl`:

```bash
curl "https://api.example.com/v1/some-endpoint" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Tip>
  Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you generated in the previous step.

## Securing Your API Key

Here are some best practices for keeping your API key secure:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do Not Expose Keys" icon="lock">
    Avoid exposing your API keys in client-side code, such as in your frontend JavaScript. This can make it easy for others to steal your key.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Environment Variables" icon="leaf">
    Store your API key in an environment variable on your server. This prevents the key from being hardcoded in your application's source code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate Your Keys" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Regularly rotate your API keys by deleting old ones and generating new ones. This can help limit the damage if a key is ever compromised.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Restrict Key Access" icon="ban">
    If possible, configure your API keys to have restricted access. For example, you may be able to limit a key to specific API endpoints or grant it read-only permissions.
